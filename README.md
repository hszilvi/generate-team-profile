The task is to take the given starter code and convert it into a working Node.js command-line application. This application will take in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

### My_process
* Create a command-line application that accepts user input using the provided starter code.   
  * Create classes for each team member provided and export them. The tests for these classes (in the `_tests_` directory) must ALL pass.     
      * Write code in `index.js` that uses inquirer to gather information about the development team members and creates objects for each team member using the correct classes as blueprints.
    * When a user starts the application then they are prompted to enter the **team manager**â€™s required data.
    * When a user enters those requirements then the user is presented with a menu with the option to:
      * Add an engineer
      * Add an intern 
      * Finish building the team
    * When a user selects the **engineer** option then a user is prompted to enter required data then user is taken back to the menu.
    * When a user selects the intern option then a user is prompted to enter the required data then the user is taken back to the menu.
    * When a user decides to finish building their team then they exit the application, and the HTML is generated.
